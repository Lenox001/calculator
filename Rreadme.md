## Essential Features for a To-Do List App

A basic to-do list app should include these core functionalities:

### Core Features:
* **Task creation:** Users should be able to add new tasks to the list.
* **Task display:** Tasks should be clearly visible, possibly with options for sorting and filtering.
* **Task completion:** Users should be able to mark tasks as completed.
* **Task deletion:** Completed or unwanted tasks can be removed from the list.

### Additional Features:
* **Task editing:** Users should be able to modify existing tasks.
* **Task prioritization:** Tasks can be assigned different levels of importance.
* **Due dates:** Tasks can have associated deadlines.
* **Task categories:** Tasks can be grouped into different categories.
* **Subtasks:** Tasks can be broken down into smaller subtasks.
* **Reminders:** Users can set reminders for tasks.
* **Task notes:** Additional details or notes can be added to tasks.
* **Theming:** Users can customize the appearance of the app.

### Technological Considerations:
* **Data storage:** Decide how to store task data (local storage, indexedDB, or a backend).
* **User interface:** Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
* **User experience:** Focus on making the app easy to use and navigate.
